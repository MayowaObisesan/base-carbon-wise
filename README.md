## Overview

**Carbon Wise**  is an innovative platform designed to combat plastic waste by transforming recycling efforts into measurable and tradeable carbon credits. By leveraging blockchain technology, Carbon-Wise empowers communities to participate in sustainability initiatives while providing financial incentives for recycling activities.

## The Platform: Carbon-Wise

**Carbon-Wise** is a platform that tokenizes real-world assets (recycled plastic) to create a transparent and verifiable market for carbon credits. Our platform enables users to deposit plastic waste at designated collection points in exchange for Deposit Tokens, which can be spent in the general marketplace. The collected plastics are then sent to recycling facilities where they are processed and converted into verifiable carbon credits. The verifiable carbon credits are then tokenized and sold to individuals, companies and governments seeking to reduce their emissions level.
